{"name":"Kahl","tagline":"Web based comic book reader written in Python","body":"### Kahl - Self Hosted Comic Repository.\r\n\r\nKahl was born out of my frustration with a lack of web-based comic book viewers. They do exist, but aren't necessarily simple. That was my aim for this, once it's up and running, it's nice and simple.\r\n\r\nThe name *Kahl* comes from the last syllable of the work 'Comical', which I was going to call this, but the name was already taken.\r\n\r\n### Current State\r\n\r\nIs it usable? Yep, it is! Get started, go for it. From here on in I don't expect to be altering the database schema much (and Database Migrations are now working, so if there are changes, your DB shouldn't get blown away when you update.)\r\n\r\nJust update with a git pull, and you should be away. I have plenty more work to do to polish Kahl off, there's still some uglies under the hood, as well as some more features to add.\r\n\r\n### Want to contribute?\r\n\r\nFeel free to contribute, fork the report and submit a pull request for changes, and I'll make some time to review.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
