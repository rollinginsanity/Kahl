<p>Kahl was born out of my frustration with a lack of web-based comic book viewers. They do exist, but aren't necessarily simple. That was my aim for this, once it's up and running, it's nice and simple.</p>

<p>The name <em>Kahl</em> comes from the last syllable of the work 'Comical', which I was going to call this, but the name was already taken.</p>

<p>Is it usable? Yep, it is! Get started, go for it. From here on in I don't expect to be altering the database schema much (and Database Migrations are now working, so if there are changes, your DB shouldn't get blown away when you update.)</p>

<p>Just update with a git pull, and you should be away. I have plenty more work to do to polish Kahl off, there's still some uglies under the hood, as well as some more features to add.</p>

<p>Feel free to contribute, fork the report and submit a pull request for changes, and I'll make some time to review.</p>
